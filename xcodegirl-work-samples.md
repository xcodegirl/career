## Work Samples

### Robertson College - Online Technology Instructor
I am currently teaching fully online, instructor guided courses in the School of Technology with Robertson College. Subjects have included C# Programming, ASP.NET Core, front-end frameworks (React, JavaScript, Azure), object-oriented programming (Java) and data analysis (Excel). Each course runs from 2 to 6 weeks and we tackle fast-paced projects using industry tools while learning theory and best practices. I design lessons delivered at least three times per week, provide sample code and support students as they complete assignments which I thoroughly review and grade. Students obtain a diploma and/or certification at the end of their studies.

This is the product I worked on, in particular the Client API for the backend features/service offered for video games and other apps. Refer to Showcase > Demos to see and play the live demo games I helped build, maintain and deploy. Refer to Showcase > Games to see some of the client products that use brainCloud. I focused on C++, mobile and console dev and Unreal Engine. I debugged and code reviewed for all supported platforms/languages.

## Silicon Hanna Inc. - Co-founder / Lead Developer
### Silicon Hanna - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt00tah-1SQtDgIPpCNTYZw
Our games in action: promo videos and demonstrations of the iOS and Android games we made and released. Check out my work in Augmented Reality for iOS. My partner, Ricardo, also demonstrates our games for which he did much of the concept and level design. I worked on much of the implementation details and tech stack research. Earlier games were 2D physics built with OpenGL and Chipmunk.

This is one of several software projects I worked on within a suite of products. My job was to work on a team on a central in-house tools library which included GUI elements, 2D visualizations with interactive features and math calculations. I interfaced a lot with the various teams to ensure consistency and feature completeness.
